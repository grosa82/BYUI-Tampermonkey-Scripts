# BYUI-Tampermonkey-Scripts
Scripts to organize important information on ILearn BYUI system

# Installation instructions
1. First install the add-on called Tampermonkey in your browser. I already used it on Chrome and Firefox, so I know it works in both of them.

2. Click on the BYUI javascript files in this repository, then click "Raw" and Tampermonkey should suggest to install them. Go ahead and install.

# Scripts objectives
BYUI Calendar List.user.js - Highlights the next 3 days of assignments, and changes the opacity of irrelevant information inside the calendar list. Makes easier to see the due dates instead on assignments availabilities information. 

BYUI Home.user.js - Changes the opacity of availabilities to more opaque, and the "important" due dates highlighted.

## Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions
# Enjoy!
